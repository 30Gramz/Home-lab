# Home-lab
This document outlines the steps I took to create a home lab environment for practicing cybersecurity skills. The lab consists of a Windows 10 laptop running Oracle VirtualBox with Ubuntu as the primary virtual machine (VM). This setup allows me to simulate real-world scenarios, test tools, and practice vulnerability management, penetration testing, and incident response.

# Steps 

# Step 1: Setting Up the Host Machine
Hardware Specifications:

Laptop: Windows 10 (64-bit)

Processor: Intel Core i5 (or equivalent)

RAM: 8GB (minimum recommended for running VMs)

Storage: 256GB SSD (for faster performance)

Install Oracle VirtualBox:

Downloaded Oracle VirtualBox from the official website.

Installed VirtualBox on the Windows 10 laptop, ensuring all default settings were selected.

Verified the installation by launching VirtualBox and checking for any errors..
